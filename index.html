            <h2>What Is Ebola?</h2>
            <p>
                Ebola, previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus species.
                <br>
                <br> Since March 2014, West Africa has experienced the largest outbreak of Ebola in history. CDC and partners have worked to contain this epidemic at its source.
                <br>
                <br> As of right now, there is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola (<em>www.cdc.gov</em>).

            <h2>How Is It Affecting the People of West Africa?</h2>
            <p>
                The people of West Africa lack health services and the hygiene products to help keep the disease at bay. With the increasing number of deaths, this leaves many children without parents.
