            <h3>Support the Response to the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa</h3>
            <p>
                We are a group of people who has come together in the midst of the Ebola crisis, with the aim of providing health services, food, clothing and educational materials to those who need help the most. Our team of dedicated volunteers has been working tirelessly to accomplish these goals since the start of the outbreak. Though the spread of Ebola has slowed significantly in West Africa in the past twelve months, and nightly newscasts have moved on to other issues, the devastation from this disaster is still wreaking havoc among the people who survived and are trying to rebuild their lives. Our organization needs your help to support hard-hit communities as they try to get back on their feet again. This is a critical time. Let us come together to make certain a crisis like this never happens again.
